# Take-Home-Salary-Calculator
CTC to In-Hand is a Python web app built with Streamlit that helps users estimate their monthly take-home salary. By entering either Annual CTC (in LPA) or Monthly Gross Salary, the app calculates standard deductions like PF, Professional Tax, and optional Health Insurance, and provides a clear breakdown of Gross, Deductions, and In-Hand Salary.
